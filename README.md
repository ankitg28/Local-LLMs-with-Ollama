# Running LLM Models Locally with Ollama
![Ollama](path/to/your/repository/Ollama_image.jpg) <br>
Unlock the Power of Local LLMs with Ollama Client - Quick &amp; Easy Setup!

This guide will walk you through the process of setting up and running large language models (LLMs) on your local machine using the Ollama client. This example uses MacOS, but the steps are similar for other operating systems.

## Installation

1. **Download the Ollama Client**

   Go to the [Ollama GitHub repository](https://github.com/ollama/ollama?tab=readme-ov-file) and download the Ollama client suitable for your operating system.

2. **Install the Ollama Client**

   Follow the installation instructions provided in the repository. For MacOS, you can usually install the client using Homebrew or by downloading a binary file.

3. **Run the Ollama Client**

   After installation, start the Ollama client by running the following command in your terminal:

   <pre>
   <code>
   ollama
   </code>
   </pre>

## Pulling LLM Models

To pull a specific LLM model, use the `ollama pull` command. Below are examples of pulling different models:

- To pull the Llama3 model with 8B parameters:

  <pre>
  <code>
  ollama pull llama3
  </code>
  </pre>

- To pull the Gemma model with 2B parameters:

  <pre>
  <code>
  ollama pull gemma:2b
  </code>
  </pre>

## Testing the Models

You can test the models by running curl commands. Here are two examples:

- **Testing the Llama3 Model:**

  <pre>
  <code>
  curl http://localhost:11434/api/generate -d '{
    "model": "llama3",  
    "prompt": "I have met Batman in real life. Give me some conversation starters and add some sarcasm",
    "stream": false
  }'
  </code>
  </pre>

  **Response:**

  <pre>
  <code>
  {
      "model": "llama3",
      "created_at": "2024-06-21T16:31:09.091672Z",
      "response": "Paneer is an Indian cheese made by curdling milk with lemon juice or vinegar. Here's a simple recipe to make paneer at home:\n\nIngredients:\n\n* 1 liter whole milk\n* 1/2 cup freshly squeezed lemon juice (or 1 tablespoon white vinegar)\n* Salt (optional)\n\nInstructions:\n\n1. Boil the milk in a large pan over medium heat.\n2. Reduce the heat to low and let the milk simmer for about 5 minutes, or until it thickens slightly and forms a thin skin on top.\n3. Remove the pan from the heat and stir in the lemon juice (or vinegar). You will start to see the milk curdle and separate into curds and whey.\n4. Let the mixture sit for about 10-15 minutes, or until the curds have firmed up and separated completely from the whey.\n5. Line a colander with cheesecloth or a clean, thin cotton cloth. Place the colander over a large bowl or pot.\n6. Carefully pour the curdled milk mixture into the lined colander.\n7. Let the excess liquid (whey) drain off for about 10-15 minutes. You can speed up the process by gently squeezing the cheesecloth or pressing down on the paneer with your hands.\n8. Once most of the whey has been removed, gather up the edges of the cheesecloth and give the paneer a gentle squeeze to remove any remaining liquid.\n9. Transfer the paneer to a plate or tray and let it cool to room temperature.\n10. You can use your freshly made paneer in recipes like palak paneer, matar paneer, or just enjoy it with some chutney and naan bread!\n\nTips:\n\n* Use fresh lemon juice for better curdling.\n* Don't over-boil the milk, as it may lead to a grainy texture.\n* If you find that your paneer is too crumbly or breaks apart easily, try adding a pinch of salt to the milk before curdling. This will help strengthen the curds.\n\nEnjoy your homemade paneer!",

  </pre>

## Observations

After experimenting with these two models, here are some observations:

1. **Llama3 Model:**
   - The Llama3 model with 8B parameters was slower but provided more detailed and valuable responses.

2. **Gemma Model:**
   - The Gemma model with 2B parameters was faster but less effective with personalized queries.

3. **Factual Prompts:**
   - Both models could handle factual prompts like "Quick recipe to make paneer," but the Llama3 model provided more comprehensive responses.
